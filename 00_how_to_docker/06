#Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It
#should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80 port
#attached to the 5000 port of Char. You can check that your container functions
#properly by visiting
#http://\<ip-de-char\>:5000 on your web browser.

docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name overlord --restart=always nginx
