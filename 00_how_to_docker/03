#Define the variables needed by your virtual machine Char in the general env of your
#terminal, so that you can run the docker ps command without errors. You have
#to fix all four environment variables with one command, and you are not allowed
#to use your shellâ€™s builtin to set these variables by hand.

eval $(docker-machine env Char)

#
#You can't run 'docker ps' on default (docker works on linux)
#So we build a vm to run our docker commands
#eval imports the 'env' variables from out vm to be able to run
#'docker' commands directly from the mac terminal
#
#eval $(docker-machine env -u)
